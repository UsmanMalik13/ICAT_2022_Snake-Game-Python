## Introduction
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game, where the objective is to collect as many "fruits" as possible without colliding with the game border or the snake's body. This project was developed by a group of students to explore game mechanics, logic implementation, and user interaction through coding.

## Project Overview
The Snake Game provides an opportunity to:
- Understand the basics of indie game development.
- Learn Python's game libraries and modules, such as `turtle`, `time`, and `random`.
- Experience the structure and design needed for a game interface and basic UI/UX concepts.
